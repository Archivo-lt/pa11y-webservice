pa11y-ws
========

pa11y-ws provides scheduled accessibility reports for multiple URLs. It runs [pa11y][pa11y] on a list of URLs, which you can update and query the results of via a JSON web-service.

**Current Version:** *0.0.0*  
**Node Version Support:** *0.10*


Setup
-----

pa11y-ws requires [Node.js][node] 0.10+ and [PhantomJS][phantom]. See the [pa11y documentation][pa11y-docs] for more information on these dependencies. pa11y-ws also requires [MongoDB][mongo] to be installed and running.

You'll then need to clone this repo locally and install dependencies with `npm install`. Once you have a local clone, you'll need to copy some sample configuration files in order to run the application. From within the repo, run the following commands:

```sh
$ cp config/development.sample.json config/development.json
$ cp config/production.sample.json config/production.json
$ cp config/test.sample.json config/test.json
```

Each of these files defines configurations for a different environment. If you're just running the application locally, then you should be OK with just development and test configurations. The [available configurations are documented here](#configurations).

Now that you've got your application configured, you can run in each mode with the following commands:

```sh
$ make start       # start in production mode
$ make start-dev   # start in development mode
$ make start-test  # start in test mode
```

Both development and test modes run the application with [Supervisor][supervisor], so you won't need to restart it if you change any JavaScript files.


Configurations
--------------

The boot configurations for pa11y-ws are as follows. Look at the sample JSON files in the repo for example usage.

### database
*(string)* The mongodb [connection string][mongo-connection-string] for your database.

### host
*(string)* The host to run the application on. This is normally best left as `"0.0.0.0"` â€“ which means the application will run on any incoming connections.

### port
*(number)* The port to run the application on.

### cron
*(string)* A crontab which describes when to generate reports for each task in the application.


Development
-----------

To develop pa11y-ws, you'll need to clone the repo and get set up as outlined in the [setup guide](#setup). Once you've done this, you'll need to start the application in test mode with:

```sh
$ make start-test
```

Now you'll be able to run the following commands:

```sh
$ make lint  # Run JSHint with the correct config
$ make test  # Run tests
```

Code with lint errors or failing tests will not be accepted, please use the build tools outlined above.

For users with push-access, don't commit to the master branch. Code should be in `develop` until it's ready to be released.
